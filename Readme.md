## Possible improvements
 - Make the city property an object containing city name, geo and other infos
   - Create a tab to have a map view of the listed companies
 - Paginate query to backend in case of more records
 - **OR** add dynamic loading of new records during scrolling
 - Checkbox form could be implemented as table filter to have a better page layout
 - Change matching rules for text search, I have used substring search to have a balance between usability and performances
 - Create a real SPA with a working side menu and so on
